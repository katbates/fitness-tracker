# fitness-tracker - A project in R

## Overview
This project was completed as my independent capstone project for the Google Data Analytics course. The scenario involved a fitness tracker company 'BellaBeat' requiring recommendations for their marketing strategy. The task involved using FitBit data to analyse user trends to inform the marketing strategy. The project uses R to clean the dataset, complete EDA, visualise data trends and make recommendations for 'BellaBeat'.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit?datasetId=1041311&sortBy=voteCount) and contains 18 csv files containing 30 users data over a month period for various activities.
